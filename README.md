# ALX LOW LEVEL PROGRAMMING.

In this section, I have been able to learn on the C programming language as a low level programming language and various aspects of the language from its syntax to functions to arithmetic operators and so much more.



## Technologies Implemented.

* Editors: **Vi text editor.**
* Files are compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **gcc** with the options **-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.**
* Code should implement Betty coding style. More information on the Betty style can be found [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty).
* For the shell scripts, they will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.



## Projects.

The following are projects done during the duration of the curriculum.
